Welcome to Bitwarden!

Here are a few simple steps to get up and running with Bitwarden Password Manager:


1. Install the browser extension
============

Autofill passwords, save new logins, access the password generator, and more from the Bitwarden browser extension. The extension keeps Bitwarden easily accessible so you can be secure while online.
Install the extension (http://www.bitwarden.com/download)


2. Add passwords to your vault
============

Your secure vault is ready to safely store your sensitive information. Add logins, credit cards, notes, and identities for fast access and autofilling!
Add passwords to your vault ({{{WebVaultUrl}}}/?utm_source=welcome_email&utm_medium=email)


3. Keep your master password safe and enable biometrics
============

Vault security starts with your Bitwarden master password. Ensure it is strong and complex, then memorize it or store it in a safe place. Now you're ready to enable biometrics for a faster login experience with fingerprint or FaceID.
