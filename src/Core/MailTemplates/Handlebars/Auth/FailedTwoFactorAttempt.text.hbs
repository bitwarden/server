Additional security has been placed on your Bitwarden account.

We've detected several failed attempts to log into your Bitwarden account. Future login attempts for your account will be protected by a captcha.

Account: {{AffectedEmail}}
Date: {{TheDate}} at {{TheTime}} {{TimeZone}}
IP Address: {{IpAddress}}

If this was you, you can remove the captcha requirement by successfully logging in. If you're having trouble with two step login, you can login using a recovery code (https://bitwarden.com/help/two-step-recovery-code/).

If this was not you, you should change your master password (https://bitwarden.com/help/master-password/#change-master-password) immediately. You can view our tips for selecting a secure master password here (https://bitwarden.com/blog/picking-the-right-password-for-your-password-manager/).
