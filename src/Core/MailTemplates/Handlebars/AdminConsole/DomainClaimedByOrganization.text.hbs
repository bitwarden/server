An {{OrganizationName}} admin has claimed the domain @{{{DomainName}}}. Your email address {{{UserEmail}}} matches this, so your Bitwarden account is now managed by {{OrganizationName}}.

What this means for you:
- Your day-to-day use of Bitwarden remains the same.
- Only store work-related items in your {{OrganizationName}} vault.
- {{OrganizationName}} admins now manage your account, meaning they can revoke or delete your account.

For more information, please refer to the following help article: Claimed accounts (https://bitwarden.com/help/claimed-accounts)
