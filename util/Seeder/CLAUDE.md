# Bitwarden Seeder Library - Claude Code Configuration

## Quick Reference

**For detailed pattern descriptions (Factories, Recipes, Models, Scenes, Queries, Data), read `README.md`.**

**For detailed usages of the Seeder library, read `util/DbSeederUtility/README.md` and `util/SeederApi/README.md`**

## Commands

```bash
# Build
dotnet build util/Seeder/Seeder.csproj

# Run tests
dotnet test test/SeederApi.IntegrationTest/

# Run single test
dotnet test test/SeederApi.IntegrationTest/ --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TestMethodName"
```

## Pattern Decision Tree

```
Need to create test data?
├─ ONE entity with encryption? → Factory
├─ MANY entities as cohesive operation? → Recipe
├─ Complete test scenario with ID mangling for SeederApi? → Scene
├─ READ existing seeded data? → Query
└─ Data transformation SDK ↔ Server? → Model
```

## The Recipe Contract

Recipes follow strict rules:

1. A Recipe SHALL have exactly one public method named `Seed()`
2. A Recipe MUST produce one cohesive result
3. A Recipe MAY have overloaded `Seed()` methods with different parameters
4. A Recipe SHALL use private helper methods for internal steps
5. A Recipe SHALL use BulkCopy for performance when creating multiple entities
6. A Recipe SHALL compose Factories for individual entity creation
7. A Recipe SHALL NOT expose implementation details as public methods

## Zero-Knowledge Architecture

**Critical:** Unencrypted vault data never leaves the client. The server never sees plaintext.

The Seeder uses the Rust SDK via FFI because it must behave like a real Bitwarden client:

1. Generate encryption keys (like client account setup)
2. Encrypt vault data client-side (same SDK as real clients)
3. Store only encrypted result

## Data Flow

```
CipherViewDto → Rust SDK encrypt_cipher → EncryptedCipherDto → TransformToServer → Server Cipher Entity
```

Shared logic: `CipherEncryption.cs`, `EncryptedCipherDtoExtensions.cs`

## Rust SDK Version Alignment

| Component   | Version Source                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Server Shim | `util/RustSdk/rust/Cargo.toml` git rev    |
| Clients     | `@bitwarden/sdk-internal` in clients repo |

Before modifying SDK integration, run `RustSdkCipherTests` to validate roundtrip encryption.

## Deterministic Data Generation

Same domain = same seed = reproducible data:

```csharp
_seed = options.Seed ?? StableHash.ToInt32(options.Domain);
```

## Security Reminders

- Test password: `asdfasdfasdf`
- Never commit database dumps with seeded data
- Seeded keys are for testing only
